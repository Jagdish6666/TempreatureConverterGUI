# TempreatureConverterGUI
In this program, we use Java Swing to create a simple GUI with input fields, a dropdown for selecting the conversion type, a button to perform the conversion, and a label to display the result. When the user clicks the "Convert" button, the appropriate conversion method is called, and the result is displayed on the GUI.
